			<h4>Hi y'all!</h4>
			<p>My name is James Weichert (pronouns: he/him) and I am a sophomore from Virginia studying computer science, data science, and public policy. I am running to be the next ASUC Academic Affairs Vice President (AAVP).</p>
			<p>I'm running for AAVP because I believe that I can hit the ground running at the start of my term and be a tireless advocate for students on academic matters. I'm running because my knowledge and experiences on matters of academic policy, student fees, technology infrastructure, and ASUC administration would be uniquely useful in the Office of Academic Affairs* and would benefit students across this campus.</p>
			<p>My campaign is focused on showing students that the next AAVP needs to be both knowledgeable of academic policies and campus bureaucratic procedures <em>and</em> be able to be a <strong>consistent voice for students</strong>, every day and in every meeting. To that end, I'm campaigning based off of my experiences and visions for the Office, and <span class="underline">not</span> based on party politics or trying to pad my resume. If there is one reason why you vote for me, it should be because <strong>I have the policies and embody the vision necessary to move this campus in a better direction</strong>. With a potential return to in-person classes this fall, it is pivotal that the next AAVP be able to seize this critical moment to push vigorously for a <strong>fundamentally different approach to academics on campus</strong>, an approach that <strong>centers students</strong> and uplifts <strong>equity and support</strong> for all students.</p>

		<h3 class="sectiontitle"><span>EXPERIENCE</span></h3>
		<br />

		<h4>AAVP Head of Staff*</h4>
		<p>I am the current Head of Staff* to ASUC Academic Affairs Vice President* Nicole Anyanwu. In that role, I lead the Office of Academic Affairs* and coordinate advocacy and outreach across all of the office's departments. As a senior leader in the office, I work with the AAVP* and other senior staff to formulate the office's policy stances and academic projects. Additionally, I accompany AAVP* Anyanwu in meetings with senior campus leaders, providing unique insights and advocating for student needs when it comes to academic policies. In fall 2020, I co-led the office's efforts to implement optional P/NP for major requirements for the 2020-2021 academic year. After working tirelessly throughout the semester, we were able to give Berkeley students much-needed academic flexibility in the form of <strong>P/NP for all undergraduate colleges</strong>.</p>
		<p>Finally, I represent the Office of Academic Affairs* and the ASUC* at large on a variety of campus administrative and Academic Senate committees, including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Academic Senate Committee on Admissions, Enrollment, and Preparatory Education*</li>
				<li>Campus Committee on Campus Policy and Management*</li>
				<li>Research, Teaching, and Learning Executive Advisory Group*</li>
				<li>Campus Academic Program Committee on the Center for Connected Learning* (Moffitt Library Renovation)</li>
				<li>Campus Academic Program Committee on the Data Hub Project*</li>
				<li>Campus Academic Program Committee on the Hesse-O'Brien Renovation*</li>
				<li>Campus Academic Program Committee on the North Field Academic Building* (Evans Temporary Replacement)</li>
			</ul>

		<br />
		<h4>Berkeley Student Fee Referenda Committee (SFRC) Co-Chair*</h4>
		<p>Aside from my work in the ASUC*, I am the co-chair of the campus' Student Fee Referenda Committee* (SFRC), having been appointed to the role by the Chancellor's Advisory Committee on Student Services and Fees* (CACSSF) in spring 2020. SFRC* is responsible for overseeing the process by which mandatory campus-wide student fees are drafted and voted on by the student body. The committee provides oversight and guidance regarding compliance with campus and University policies and recommends improvements in campus referenda policies to the Chancellor*. As a co-chair, I lead and manage the committee and provide input on referenda practices as a member of CACSSF*.</p>
		<p>In leading SFRC* over the past year, I have prioritized the responsible and student-centered management and governance of the entire Berkeley student fee ecosystem. Working with administrators, student leaders, and fee proponents, I have facilitated discussions around how to promote a better understanding of what student fee dollars are being used for and to require continual student-led oversight of the efficacy and need of the more than $40 million dollars in annual student fee revenue. Sitting as a non-voting member of CACSSF* has also provided me with insight into the Student Services Fee (SSF) grant process, which is a crucial source of funding for many student initiatives. Above all, I have worked to safeguard the right  to student self-governance on campus-based student fees, a central part of the student experience and ethos at Berkeley.</p>

		<br />
		<h4>ASUC Elections Council Chair* (2019-2020)</h4>
		<p>During the 2019-2020 academic year, I was the ASUC Elections Council Chair* and oversaw the ASUC elections process. I was responsible for organizing and executing the 2020 ASUC election, which saw a student turnout of 11,100 students, an increase from the previous year. In my capacity as Elections Council Chair*, I was charged with navigating a complex and opaque ASUC bureaucracy and for effectively communicating various bylaws to candidates and the general student body. I used my position in the ASUC* to push for transformational changes to the Association's elections process in favor of transparency, equity, and accessibility. I wrote and passed a number of ASUC Senate* resolutions relating to elections processes, including a resolution that established a temporary ad-hoc committee to study the feasibility of public campaign financing for ASUC elections. The committee continued even after the end of my term on the Elections Council* and produced a report highlighting the enormous impact on financial accessibility that public campaign funding would have on this campus.</p>

		<br />
		<h4>Berkeley Student Technology Council*</h4>
		<p>As a member of the campus' Student Technology Council*, I provide senior campus IT leadership* with insight about student needs and perspectives on campus technology infrastructure, including feedback on new technology initiatives.</p>

		<div class="center"><h4>Let's Have an Honest Conversation About "Academic Accommodations"</h4>
		<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/703bNnH10VY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

		<br />

		<p>As this year's fight for P/NP and other academic accommodations has shown, it is crucial that the Academic Affairs Vice President be capable of presenting and lobbying for a robust set of student-centered academic policies. The Office of the AAVP* encompasses a broad range of responsibilities, from academic policies to leadership on campus budget and student fee priorities to appointing ASUC representatives to campus committees. As such, the AAVP needs to have broad knowledge of how this campus operates and an overarching vision for how to lead this campus forward. Below are the nine platforms I am running on and why they matter.</p>

		<h3 class="sectiontitle"><span>WHY ME?<span></span></h3>
		<br />

		<p>I am running for Academic Affairs Vice President because I firmly believe that I am the right person to lead the Office of Academic Affairs* and the ASUC at large, building on major victories achieved by the Office* during this academic year in support of equity and student support in academic life at Berkeley. As the current Head of Staff* for the Office of Academic Affairs*, I am best positioned to leverage my existing knowledge and relationships to hit the ground running during this pivotal time in this campus' history. I have the experience to work with administrators and faculty on day one and to achieve major victories for students even before the start of the  fall semester (yes, I will work through the summer). The next Academic Affairs Vice President needs to be equipped to dive head-first into the academic problems that have not only plagued students during the pandemic, but also before the outset of remote instruction. <strong>I am the right person for the job.</strong></p>

		<p>But the ASUC Academic Affairs Vice President cannot be <strong>solely</strong> focused on just academic policy. The portfolio of responsibilities of the AAVP involves appointing all ASUC representatives to administrative and Academic Senate* committees, providing input on student fee management through CACSSF* and the Wellness Fund*, coordinating with other ASUC leaders in the development of campus technology infrastructure, promoting student wellness and professional development, and being a leader in the Association and on campus. In this respect, I will also draw heavily on my experiences as co-chair* of the campus Student Fee Referenda Committee* (SFRC), member of the Student Technology Council*, and former ASUC Elections Council Chair*. I hope to combine my existing familiarity with ASUC administrative processes and bylaws, knowledge of the Berkeley student fee ecosystem, and passion for technology to augment every aspect of my work as AAVP. Now, more than ever, this campus needs an Academic Affairs Vice President that can work towards solutions in <strong>all facets of campus student life</strong>. As AAVP, I would bring together my hands-on experience in the Office of Academic Affairs*, knowledge of the student fee system and concern for student-led oversight, and my leadership on campus and in the Association to fully support students on this campus. <strong>I am running for Academic Affairs Vice President because I want to help <span class="underline">you</span> succeed at Berkeley.</strong></p>
