			<h4>AAVP* Nicole Anyanwu Endorses James Weichert</h4>
			<p id="orange_highlight"><strong>"I don’t know where to even start with James, because words cannot express the magnitude of his contributions and the immense respect and gratitude, I have for him."</strong></p>
			<p>"His unrelenting dedication and extreme involvement in our campus-wide policy initiatives, the managing of our meeting strategy and communication channels, and steering of our student campaigns has been so critical to the successes achieved by the Office of the Academic Affairs Vice President* this year; and with that being said, no other candidate in this race is more qualified, prepared, and determined to make change at such a pivotal time for student welfare and equitable access.</p>
			<p>"James has been a community-partner, meeting religiously with the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP)* to orient the AAVP’s* strategy on applying administrative pressure for issues surrounding the campus’ most marginalized, and has  been a vocal advocate for the  inclusion and prioritization of DSP* students in campus return pilot programs and resource allocation.</p>
			<p>"He is an engaged student voice, aware of the pervasive and extensive issues students have faced prior to, and now in the pandemic, and how these issues have only been exacerbated. James has never sat back, and has always acted making waves on remote proctoring policies, professor accountability to student accommodations, and of course the infamous Pass/No Pass Policy implementation for both Fall 2020 and Spring 2021, an AAVP* office effort that was the result of his collective over 300+ hours of advocacy, policy, and memo work, in addition to his analysis of thousands of student survey testimonials, coordination of various administrative meetings, and his launch of our office’s #CalDuringCOVID Campaign.</p>
			<p>"He is known to all campus administrators, and campus Redditors alike, giving his elaborate and thoughtful opinions in stakeholder meetings, and supporting the countless students who have reached out to our office for help whether it be through Twitter, email, or Reddit.</p>
			<p>"He is no stranger to hearing out the everyday student and bringing them to the table with administrators, and has never taken “NO” for an answer, and even in times when things seemed definite, James has been able to pivot the office towards further progress.</p>
			<p>"He has worked in collaboration with international community leaders to demand action by administrators on issues our campus international community faces, and has been an integral part of configuring equity in the CS and capped major processes, as well as campus admissions, all in partnership with notable faculty and campus staff. James is well-informed and a formidable voice on campus academic committees and tasks forces, and he is the type of student leader we will need given the challenges that will be presented in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. He mixes visionary leadership with practical application and pathways to make his great visions actionable and successful. </p>
			<p>"For James, this is not about party-politics or a power trip, for him this is serious business, on behalf of impacted students who he has been able to work with and overall, whose voices have not always been heard by the administration. For James, this role is about re-envisioning the future of undergraduate education, and building a culture in which students control the narrative and are listened to and heard.</p>
			<p>"I have been incredibly honored to have James in my office this year, and watch the impact he made from the first time he stepped foot on campus. I visibly remember being stunned watching this kid show up so strong and assured in the work he was conducting in his first year on campus, and was awe-struck by his mind-blowing dedication and eagerness to be involved, grow, and learn. And, I can say to this day, I have only been moved and further inspired by his leadership, professionalism, and general love for his campus community and others. James is strategic, knowledgeable, inclusive, and forward-thinking, and I could not be happier or more proud to endorse him to fill the role of Academic Affairs Vice President*.</p>
			<p>"If you have have been touched by the work of this office and have benefitted from its success and advocacy, I encourage you to join me in supporting James Weichert to be your ASUC Academic Affairs Vice President* this ASUC* Election Season."</p>
